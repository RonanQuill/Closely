# Closely
Closely is a social media blogging app where you connect with other users using NFC.

To test our NFC features in an android emulator you can use the following app that we made to emulate an NFC intent being created https://github.com/RonanQuill/Closely-NFCSpoofing/tree/master.
The NFC message to connect with another user is created by touching 2 NFC capable device together, unfortunately it is not possible to demonstrate this without physical devices.

# Testing

When testing the application you can sign up for the application and create your own profile. If you want to connect to another user that is currently created use the NFC Spoofer above with one of the UIDs of the users listed below.
