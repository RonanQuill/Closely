### Note
In our contributions page, it shows Wiktor (Heziip) as only having 1 commit, however this is due to technical issues he had with getting the android emulator to work with his CPU architecture (AMD Ryzen). Instead of directly commiting Wiktor contributed through pair programming session over discrod/zoom with us, so it would be fair to say he contributed as much as the rest of us. - Rónán, Rían, Donal
